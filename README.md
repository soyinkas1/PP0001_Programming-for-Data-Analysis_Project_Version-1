# PP0001_Programming-for-Data-Analysis_Project_World Energy Data
This is a project submiited as as part of my course work for M.Sc Data Science from Cardiff Metropolitan University. The Jupyter notebook -version 1 (V1) is my first attempt at the analysis of the dataset and was graded for the course as 83% out of 100%. I would be working on a version 2 (and more versions in the future) of this project to take the analysis further towards the initially defined objective of the project.
